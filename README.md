# Dataset and Statistical Models for Video QoE Analysis

This repository hosts a subset of dataset we have the permission to release at this point of time. We will update it with additional datasets when appropriate authorization has been procured. In addition, we will provide a pointer to the paper once it is available.

```data``` folder contains all of the urban datasets and one rural dataset, for all the telecom providers. ```models``` folder contains the top performing algorithms and their respective architecture.

If you implement our network models, please use the following citation:
